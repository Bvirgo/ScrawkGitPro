// Fragment shader, Tiled Directional Flow
//
// (c) 2010 frans van hoesel, university of groningen
//
//
// this shader creates animated water by transforming normalmaps
// the scaling and rotation of the normalmaps is done per tile
// and is constant per tile. Each tile can have its own parameters
// for rotation, scaling, and speed of translation
// To hide the seams between the tiles, all seams have another tile
// centered over the seam. The opacity of the tiles decreases towards the
// edge of the tiles, so the edge isn't visible at all.
// Basically, all points have four tiles (A,B,C and D), mixed together
// (although at the edges the contribution of a tile to this mix is 
// reduced to zero).
// The mixing of the tiles each with different parameters gives a nice
// animated look to the water. It is no longer just sliding in one direction, but
// appears to move more like real water. 

// The resulting sum of normalmaps, is used to calculate the refraction of the clouds 
// in a cube map and can also be used for other nice effects. In this example the 
// colormap of the material under water is distorted to fake some kind of refraction
// (for this example the water is a bit too transparent, but it shows this refraction
// better) 

// A flowmap determines in the red and green channel the normalized direction of the
// flow and in the blue channel wavelength.
// The alpha channel is used for the transparency of the water. Near the edge, the 
// water becomes less deep and more transparent. Also near the edge, the waves tend
// to be smaller, so the same alpha channel also scales the height of the waves.
// Currently the wavelength is in its own channel (blue), but could be premultiplied
// to the red and green channels. This makes this channel available for changing the 
// speed of the waves per tile.


// Further improvements
// Besides the obvious improvements mentioned in the code (such as premultiplying
// the direction of the waves with the scale, or moving the texscale multiplication
// to the texture coordinates), one could get rid of tiling in this code and pass it 
// tiled geometry. This way the whole lookup of the flowmap (which is constant over 
// each tile) could be moved to the vertexshader, removing the the construction of 
// the flow rotation matrix. As this is done 4 times per pixel, it might give a big 
// performance boost (one does need to pass on 4 constant matrices to the fragment
// shader, which will cost you a bit of performance).
